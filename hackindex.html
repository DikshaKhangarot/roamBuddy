    <p><big>Travelling can be an amazing experience full of adventure and excitement. But it’s not unusual to face some problems along the way. Being ready to face and deal with these problems is crucial for making your travels more enjoyable and creating lasting memories</big></p>
</p><br><br><br><br>
<big><b>Canceled, delayed, or unreliable transportation:</b></big><br><p>Transportation snags are largely out of your own hands, so avoiding them may not always be possible. Instead, the best way to minimize the impact is to seek out alternative routes to arrive at a destination just in case. Familiarize yourself with all possible options like a bus vs train, and what to do if your plans get altered. Knowing who to contact about a canceled train beforehand, for example, will help you act quicker and be less stressed if faced with that situation.
</p>></a><br><br><br><br>
<big><b>Forgotten can’t-live-without items</b></big><br><p> This may go without saying, yet it’s not always a rule of thumb that travelers follow: Create a packing list and double check before leaving! Yes, that means start writing down your absolute essentials days or even weeks before your departure to make sure you account for everything. Leaving it all to your memory in a last minute packing spree won’t do you any favors..</p><br><br>
<big><b>Gaps between check-out and check-in times</b></big><br><p> Accommodation hosts can be quite flexible when there isn’t another guest immediately arriving the same day, so see if you can get a check-out extension. Other great options are to ask about luggage storage at your accommodation (usually available at no additional cost) or even at bus and train stations..</p><a href="https://www.goabroad.com/articles/choosing-the-right-travel-accommodation">READ MORE..</a><br><br><br><br>

    <p>Accommodation is the first thing on everyone’s mind when traveling. The internet has made finding and booking places to stay during travels significantly easier. But there are problems such as:<br><br><br>

        – False advertisement<br>
        – Scams<br>
        – Dirty rooms/sheets<br>
        
        If you have to book your accommodation online, only do so through trusted third-party services or book directly with the hotel to avoid scams. Look through reviews and pictures of the property and rooms before booking. You can learn more here about a few trusted hotels and their special offers.
        Here are some trusted websites through which you can book accomodations:-<br><br>

            <p><big> Keeping your possessions safe should be a top priority. When you’re in a foreign place, you’re less aware of your surroundings, and you can easily end up in an unsafe area where the risk of getting robbed is higher. Some criminals specifically target tourists as they see them as easy targets.</big></p>
            <big> <b> Is it better to travel with cash or card?</b></big><br><p>Pros and cons of using a credit card abroad
              Pro: May offer a better exchange rate than when using cash
              Pro: If lost or stolen, a card is easier to replace and potentially get your money back
              Pro: More secure than carrying cash
              Pro: Score points on credits that can be used for future travel and other purchases
              Con: If you forget to alert your bank, your charges could be flagged as fraudulent (and they may shut off your card, leaving you stranded)
              Con: You may be charged international transaction fees on every purchase</p><br><br>
              <p> Pros and cons of using cash while traveling
                  Pro: Avoid international transaction fees on your purchases
                  Pro: You’ll always have money available for tips or cash-only vendors
                  Pro: It supports the local economy more directly
                  Pro: You can order local currency in advance from your bank or organizations like AAA
                  Con: Less secure than carrying a card (lost or stolen cash is most likely gone forever)
                  Con: ATM fees and account fees for cash withdrawls abroad can be huge, especially at out-of-network ATMs
                  Con: Difficult to know how much you’ll need, potentially leaving you stranded if ATMs or Western Union are scarce</p>
                  <big><b>  Hackers</b></big><br><p> You might not think about it too often when travelling, but cybersecurity is a real threat that you always need to be aware of. As a tourist, you’re even more vulnerable to getting hacked if you constantly connect to public WiFi, which can have a hacker on the other end. Even your hotel networks aren’t entirely safe.

                      To protect yourself, always use a VPN when connecting to any network abroad. A good VPN will secure your connection at all times. Additionally, keep your devices physically secured. Make backups of your data before you leave in case your device gets stolen</p>

                            <p><big> EXCHANGE CURRENCY has gotten so much easier over the past few years (good riddance, traveler’s cheques!). However, each country and region still has its own process for exchanging currency, so bringing a wad of cash with you and crossing fingers that it will all work out may not be your best bet. In some areas, traveling with that much cash on hand may raise safety concerns as well.</big></p>
                             <br><br><br><br>
                         <big><b>SOLUTION: Check in with your home bank to see what your options are for your target destination. In some cases, you can easily access an ATM with a debit card abroad for minimal fees. Some banks will also exchange money for you before you leave if you request it ahead of time, so you have a bit of cash on hand to navigate the first few days on a trip.</b></big>

                                    <p><big>Following are the guildlines made by INDIA government for their native people -</big></p>

    exploitations, including commercial sexual exploitation like prostitution, 
    sex tourism and trafficking of persons for it.<br>

    punishment of 3- 7 years.<br>
    ▪ It is a myth that sexual intercourse with a virgin or a minor will cure STI or 
    prevent HIV. It only spreads the disease further.<br>
    ▪ Abetment to crime amounts to committing the crime itself.<br>
    ▪ Victims of exploitation are not criminals. They are persons in need of care, 
    protection, legal, medical and psychological assistance.<br>
    ▪ Under section 7 of Immoral Traffic Prevention Act, 1956, letting out a hotel 
    or any part there off for prostitution is an offence for which the license of 
    the hotel can be suspended.<br>
